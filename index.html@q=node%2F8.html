<ul><li>Roughly 98% of  consumers will leave a website without converting after clicking on your e-mail </li>
<li>On average, 8% of  customers return to a site to buy if the company does no retargeting – but  jumps to 26% with retargeting </li>
</ul><p>Email Retargeting identifies users  who have already opened or clicked on your e-mail by displaying your ad as they  visit other websites and allowing you to continue the conversation with them.  In surveys, 87% of digital marketers indicated that retargeting is important to  their overall marketing strategy and often performs better than other forms of  online advertising, helping to driving incremental conversions. It makes practical  sense, that a user has already shown interest in your message and is more  receptive to hearing from you.</p>
<p><strong>What’s included? </strong></p>
<ul><li>Ad Serving –  getting your ads from our computers to your customers computers </li>
<li>Views – ensuring  that your advertising will be viewed by human users </li>
<li>Brand Integrity –  knowing exactly what type of content wi62ll surround your advertising and  preventing your ad from appearing adjacent to questionable content (e.g. adult,  hate speech, etc.) </li>

</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can your potential customers find you on  the Internet?</strong><br /><strong><em>Search</em></strong> is  the answer! With 83% of all users using the Internet to search for products and  services and 35% of those searches having local intent, it’s easy to understand  the importance of having a search strategy, both long and short term. There are  3 common components to search marketing to maximize 100% of the SERP. (search  engine results page)</p>
<p><strong>SEO: </strong>SEO  stands for Search Engine Optimization. This is the act of enhancing a website  so it ranks higher on major search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Google  uses over 200 grading factors when determining what websites to rank. The wide  majority of the factors deal with how relevant and popular the website is in  relationship to the keywords they are targeting. Improving a website’s  relevance and popularity will help it rank higher. Create multiple, highly  targeted landing pages based on the most common keyword searches. Each page is  SEO optimized on the backend to increase traffic and drive more leads to your  business.</p>
<p><strong>Maps Optimization: </strong>Maps Optimization is the act of enhancing a local Google Map Listing so  it receives more exposure when someone conducts a local search. It’s considered  to be the most important method involved within a local online marketing  campaign. Google grades local businesses according to three major factors:  location, relevance, and popularity. Having a precise location and optimizing a  businesses relevance and popularity will increase their exposure in the maps  section. </p>
<p><strong>PPC: </strong>PPC  stands for pay per click. This is the act of renting search engine ad space on  a per click basis. It is the quickest way to drive traffic to a website. Naturally  obtaining front page rankings is cumbersome. This is why major search engines  allow businesses to rent ad space on their front page. This allows businesses  to bid for placement and compete for their targeted keywords. Having a  structured PPC campaign allows you to maximize your exposure and ROI. At DLC  Marketing Group, our fully automated engine allows you to create and execute  geo-targeted paid search simply by entering in the business name and URL. Our  system automatically creates a high quality ad based on similar,  high-performing ads and then traffics and dynamically adjusts bidding to optimize  ROI.</p>
